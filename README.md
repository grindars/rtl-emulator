This is an emulator of Soviet UT-88 minicomputer that I had briefly. It was written to test feasibility of developing software for full-blown hardware platform on its RTL model. Well, it's not feasible. It's deadly slow.

Written ca. jun. 2012.

# Prerequisites
- SDL
- verilator
- lots of patience

# Building
Simply make it.
